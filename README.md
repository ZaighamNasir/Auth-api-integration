üîÑ Authentication Flow

1. Register

User signs up via /register page.

Backend saves the user in MongoDB with hashed password.

2. Login

User enters email/password on /login page.

Backend verifies credentials, returns a JWT token.

Token is stored in localStorage.

3. Dashboard

Protected route that checks if JWT exists.

Token is decoded to show username & email.

If token is missing or invalid ‚Üí redirect to /login.

4. Logout

Clears token from localStorage and redirects to /login.

5. Forgot Password

User enters their email.

Backend sends OTP to the email.

User enters OTP + new password.

Backend verifies OTP and updates the password.
